# Conclusion & Takeaways: Mechanistic Interpretability

## Final Insight
Neural networks are not black boxes. They are transparent, mechanistic systems. Through systematic geometric, feature, circuit, and causal analysis, we have shown that:

- Data manifolds untangle across layers
- Neurons encode interpretable features
- Circuits are modular and identifiable
- Behavior is causally predictable and editable

## The Path Forward
- Deep learning is engineering, not magic
- We can debug, control, and improve networks with precision
- This framework is extensible to larger models and real-world systems

## For Further Work
- Scale to CNNs, transformers, and real-world datasets
- Apply causal editing to adversarial robustness and model debugging
- Use these tools for automated interpretability and transparency in AI
